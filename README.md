# Python Loan Calculator :arrow_right: Stage 4

**Description**

Finally, let's add to our calculator the capacity to compute differentiated payments. Weâ€™ll do this for the type of repayment where the loan principal is reduced by a constant amount each month. The rest of the monthly payment goes toward interest repayment and it is gradually reduced over the term of the loan. This means that the payment is different each month.

Stage 4 In this stage, you are going to implement the following features:

```code
Calculation of differentiated payments. To do this, the user can run the program specifying interest, number of monthly payments, and loan principal.
Ability to calculate the same values as in the previous stage for annuity payment (principal, number of monthly payments, and monthly payment amount). The user specifies all the known parameters with command-line arguments, and one parameter will be unknown. This is the value the user wants to calculate.
Handling of invalid parameters. It's a good idea to show an error message if the user enters invalid parameters (they are discussed in detail below).
```

The final version of your program is supposed to work from the command line and parse the following parameters:

```code
--type indicates the type of payment: "annuity" or "diff" (differentiated). If --type is specified neither as "annuity" nor as "diff" or not specified at all, show the error message. 
--payment is the monthly payment amount. For --type=diff, the payment is different each month, so we can't calculate months or principal, therefore a combination with --payment is invalid, too: 
--principal is used for calculations of both types of payment. You can get its value if you know the interest, annuity payment, and number of months.
--periods denotes the number of months needed to repay the loan. It's calculated based on the interest, annuity payment, and principal.
```
